\section{Conclusion}

This paper describes {\small CUBEP3M}, a P$^3$M N-body public code that is massively parallel, memory local, 
and that scales well to 20,000 cores, thus raising the limits of the cosmological problem size one can handle.
We summarize the code structure, the two-mesh Poisson solver algorithm, we present scaling and systematic tests
that have been performed. We also describe a few utilities and extensions that come with the public release, 
including a run time halo finder, an extended pp force calculation and a non-Gaussian initial condition generator.

The code is publicly available on github.com under {\tt cubep3m}, and extra documentation about the structure, 
compiling and running strategy is can be found at {\tt www.wiki.cita.utoronto.ca/mediawiki/index.php/CubePM}.
