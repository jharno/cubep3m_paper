%\subsection{Generalization of the dark energy equation of state}
%\label{subsec:runningomegal}
%
%The cosmic expansion is obtained from a third order Taylor expansion in the scale factor of Friedmann's equation,
%and has now the flexibility to accomodate a running equation of state of the form $\omega(a) = \omega_0 + a\omega_1$,
%which is the standard parameterization adopted by the Dark Energy Task Force \citep{2006astro.ph..9591A}.
%The code also currently supports expansion under a modified Chaplygin gas cosmology\cite{Chaplygin}. 
%{\bf Is this worth mentioning at all?}
